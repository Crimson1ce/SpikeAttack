Run the executable `run_game` to compile and run the code.

The game doesn't accept user input: the direction the player moves in is hardcoded in this version.

This game was developed in order to be implemented on a Nuvoton Nu-LB-NUC140 board that allowed the user to move freely by pressing the buttons.

Developed as an exercise for the Embedded System Design @ NDHU 2025 class laboratory.
